# HCSS-datastory
This is a onepager with a datastory about the development of voting behaviour between the US and the EU since 2000

I've worked on this project for 6 weeks with two designers for a client: HCSS. The objective was to write a datastory about a subject of choice using data from their tool called GINA. This is the result of our effort.
